# MAGIC # Demonstration - Monitoring Model Quality
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demonstration, we will investigate how Databricks enables drift detection using various tools and features such as Notebooks, Queries, Dashboards, Alerts, while emphasizing Lakehouse Monitoring. Lakehouse Monitoring is leveraged to monitor the quality and statistical properties of data and ML models within the Databricks Lakehouse architecture. It allows you to track data quality, detect anomalies, and monitor the performance of ML models and model-serving endpoints.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As a part of the classroom setup, we will bring in a pre-generated inference table (with Change Data Feed enabled) utilizing Databricks' Marketplace as well as a baseline dataset to help demonstrate how we can detect and investigate drift. In practice, it is recommended that Delta Lake's Change Data Feed (CDF), which allows Databricks to track row-level changes between versions of a Delta table, be enabled on inference tables by default. By leveraging CDF, data scientists can more efficiently create and monitor inference tables.

# MAGIC ## Inference and Feature Tables
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As a part of the classroom setup, we have created two tables:
# MAGIC 1. `model_logs`: This is our inference table. It contains inference data from a sequence of queries that were made prior to this demo and will act as our dataset that is drifting away from the baseline data `(You can search for the dataset in the Marketplace by the name: Inference Dataset for Machine Learning Operations Associate Course.)`. 
# MAGIC 1. `baseline_features`: This is our baseline table and acts as our source of truth.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **A Remark on Inference Tables and Inference Profiles**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC It's important to distinguish between an inference table when thinking about the assets we will be working with. An inference table can be thought of as a collection of logs from the model that contain the input features at runtime and predicted labels. You can also include the true labels if they are available. On the other hand, an inference profile is an inference table that also contains profile metrics like F1-score, accuracy, or other evaluation metrics that measure the performance of the model on the inferred data.

# COMMAND ----------

primary_table_name = 'model_logs'
baseline_table_name = 'baseline_features'

primary_df = spark.read.format('delta').table(primary_table_name)
primary_pdf = primary_df.toPandas()

baseline_df = spark.read.format('delta').table(baseline_table_name)

# MAGIC ### Motivating Drift Investigation
# MAGIC We'll take a cross-sectional snapshot of the distributions of BMI and Diabete_binary data to compare the ground truth to the data in our inference table.

# COMMAND ----------

# Compare distributions for a feature
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Randomly sample from the pandas dataframe baseline_pdf with samples equal to the size of primary_pdf
baseline_pdf_sample = baseline_pdf.sample(n=len(primary_pdf), random_state=1)

# MAGIC ## Lakehouse Monitoring
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To monitor the performance of the model we used to build our premade `model_logs` table, we will attach the monitor to this table. Our baseline table `baseline_features` is what we can consider as our *good* or *source of truth* data. The Databricks monitor creates out-of-the-box metrics that are important and sets up two tables: 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Profile metrics table: This keeps track of profile metrics, which is a summary statistic computed for each column. 
# MAGIC 1. Drift metrics table:  This keeps track of changes in profile metrics compared to baseline or previous time window. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC These two tables are used to automatically generate a monitoring dashboard. Later, we will uses these tables to build an alert for drift.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Option 1: Using the UI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's first start with recalling how we can use the UI to setup with Lakehouse Monitoring
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To add a monitor on the inference table, 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Open the **Catalog** menu from the left menu bar.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Select the table **model_logs** within your catalog and schema. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Click on the **Quality** tab then on the **Enable** button.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. After clicking Enable, select **Configure**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. As **Profile type** select **Inference profile**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. As **Problem type** select **classification**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. As the **Prediction column** select **Diabetes_binary**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. As the **Label column** select **labeled_data**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. As **Metric granularities** select **5 minutes**, **1 hour**, and **1 day**. We will use the doctored timestamps to simulate requests that have been received over a large period of time. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. As **Timestamp column** select **timestamp**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. As **Model ID column** select **model_id**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. In Advanced Options --> **Unity catalog baseline table name (optional)** enter **Your baseline table name** from above along with your catalog and schema(Eg: catalog.schema.table_name).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. Click the **Create** button.

# MAGIC ## Explore the Lakehouse Monitoring Dashboard
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Methods for accessing the dashboard:
# MAGIC 1. Run the next cell and click on the generated link. This will take you to the `model_logs` in the Catalog Explorer.
# MAGIC 1. Select Quality and click on View Dashboard.  
# MAGIC 1. The Dashboard (and other assets) are automatically registered to the lineage of `model_logs` as a part of comprehensive and automated tracking with Unity Catalog. 
# MAGIC 1. Setting the `ASSETS_DIR` gives the location for where the generated dashboards are actually stored. In this demo, this is set to `f"/Workspace/Users/{DA.username}/databricks_lakehouse_monitoring/{primary_table_name}"`. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the data quality and statistical properties of the tables being monitored. It helps in tracking data integrity, statistical distribution, and data drift over time. This is where you will prebuilt widgets that incorporate the metrics generated from the profile and drift metric tables. The dashboard should be thought of as a starting point for monitoring for drift, hence it is fully customizable. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - At the top left you can toggle between viewing the **Canvas** or the underlying **Data** that was generated with dashboard using SQL logic. Note that if a widget is currently being used, then the dataset created cannot be deleted. 
# MAGIC - Select widget that reads # Inferences on the left side of the canvas
# MAGIC     - Click on the kebab and select View Dataset. This will take you to the generated SQL code that you can use for further analysis with the SQL Editor or in this notebook.
# MAGIC     - Try editing the code and clicking Run to see how you can analyze the underlying tables generated as a part of the Dashboard creation.
# MAGIC - Back in the canvas, notice some metrics may appear as `null` or indicate **no data available**. This is expected since we are working with a sample dataset, since the automatically generated SQL code has logic that might not agree with this dataset such as comparing only baseline features or compute metrics on categorical features, which we are not considering here. If a baseline table was provided, drift metrics will be monitored. 
# MAGIC - For example, scroll down to the **Numerical Feature Drift** section and inspect the code for **# Features with Numerical Drift**. Notice that this SQL code only investigates the last window from the drift table. 
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# Extract workspace URL
workspace_url = spark.conf.get('spark.databricks.workspaceUrl')

# Construct the monitor dashboard URL
monitor_dashboard_url = f"https://{workspace_url}/explore/data/{DA.catalog_name}/{DA.schema_name}/model_logs?o={DA.schema_name}&activeTab=quality"

print(f"Monitor Dashboard URL: {monitor_dashboard_url}")

# MAGIC **🚨 Instructor Note - Model Id Parameter Setup in in Data Tab of Dashboard**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If you see “Missing selection for parameter: Model Id” in the dashboard, this happens because the Model Id filter is not automatically applied to all widgets.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To fix this:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - In the dashboard toolbar, find the Model Id field at the top.
# MAGIC - Manually type * (asterisk) in the Model Id box - this selects all model IDs.
# MAGIC - Press Enter or click Run to refresh the dashboard.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 💡 Typing `*` tells the dashboard to include every available Model Id, so all widgets and queries render correctly.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > **⚠️ Note:**  
# MAGIC > You may encounter a `CAST_INVALID_INPUT` error in the **Numerical Feature Quantile Drift** widget.  
# MAGIC > This occurs because the auto-generated query attempts to cast the string `"Baseline"` to a `TIMESTAMP` type in the `Window` column.  
# MAGIC > While this error does not affect other metrics or drift detection functionality, you can optionally resolve it using the steps below.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Steps to Diagnose and Fix the Error (Optional)**
# MAGIC - **Step 1:**  
# MAGIC   Navigate to the **Numerical Feature Quantile Drift** widget in the monitoring dashboard.  
# MAGIC   If there's a rendering failure, you will see a `CAST_INVALID_INPUT` error message displayed within the widget.
# MAGIC - **Step 2:**  
# MAGIC   Click the **kebab menu (⋮)** in the top-right corner of the widget and select **View Dataset**.  
# MAGIC   This opens the SQL query that powers the visual.
# MAGIC - **Step 3:**  
# MAGIC   In the dataset editor, scroll down and click **Diagnose error**.  
# MAGIC   The Databricks Assistant will analyze the issue and provide a suggested fix.
# MAGIC - **Step 4:**  
# MAGIC   Click **Replace active cell content** to apply the Assistant’s suggested query.  
# MAGIC   The corrected query will ensure the `Window` column in the baseline portion uses a proper timestamp type, typically by replacing `"Baseline"` with `CAST(NULL AS TIMESTAMP)`.
# MAGIC - **Step 5:**  
# MAGIC   Click **Run** to execute the updated query.
# MAGIC - **Step 6:**  
# MAGIC   Once the query runs successfully, the widget should render correctly, and the error message will disappear.
# MAGIC This fix helps ensure type consistency in the `UNION` clause across datasets, resolving the rendering error in the visual.

# MAGIC - Click on the dropdown menu for the Value and select **Count** under Field and select **SUM** under **Transform**
# MAGIC - Click on the dropdown menu under **Target** and select Window under Field and select **COUNT DISTINCT**
# MAGIC - Double click on the title to change the title to **# Inferences and Intervals Monitored**. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You will see a new counter displayed now that shows the total inference load over time and how many distinct windows there are. You can also resize the visual by dragging the corner inward or outward. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Select the kebab again
# MAGIC - Here you can download the data for this visualization and copy a link to the widget if you would like to share it with your team. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Custom Visual
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Additionally, you build your own visual.
# MAGIC - At the bottom of the canvas, there is a blue box that contains **Select** **Add a visualization**, **Add a textbox**, and **Add a filter**. Select **Add a visualization**. 
# MAGIC - In the visualization editor on the right of your screen:
# MAGIC         - Select **profile_over_time** under **Dataset**
# MAGIC         - Select **Counter** under **Visualization**
# MAGIC         - Select **f1_score** under **Field** and **COUNT** under **Transform**
# MAGIC         - Select **Title** under **Widget** and give it title **# F1-Scores Over Time**
# MAGIC - Finally, inspect the SQL generated for this widget. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Additional Customization
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can also build custom SQL code to build an even more customized visual by select **Create from SQL** at the very bottom of the Datasets pane to the left in the **Data** tab. Note this requires a detailed understanding of the profile and drift metrics tables and your specific goals for creating the new dataset(s).

# MAGIC ### A Closer Look at Out-Of-The-Box Metrics
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The profile metrics table and drift metrics table created by Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring contain different types of information to help monitor and analyze data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Profile Metrics Table:
# MAGIC 1. **Summary Statistics:**  
# MAGIC    Contains summary statistics for each column, such as count, number of null values, distinct count, minimum, maximum, average, standard deviation, and more.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Time Window and Slices:**  
# MAGIC    Metrics are computed for specified time intervals (windows) and for each data slice defined by slicing expressions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Grouping Columns:**  
# MAGIC    Includes columns like time window, granularity, log type (input or baseline table), slice key and value, and model ID (for InferenceLog analysis).

# MAGIC    For InferenceLog analysis, it includes metrics like accuracy score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 5. **Fairness and Bias Statistics:**  
# MAGIC    For classification models, it includes metrics like predictive parity, predictive equality, equal opportunity, and statistical parity.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Drift Metrics Table:
# MAGIC 1. **Drift Statistics:**  
# MAGIC    Tracks changes in distribution for a metric, comparing either to a previous time window (consecutive drift) or to a baseline distribution (baseline drift).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 2. **Comparison Windows:**  
# MAGIC    Includes columns for the current and comparison time windows.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 3. **Drift Types:**  
# MAGIC    Indicates whether the drift is compared to the previous window or a baseline table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 4. **Metrics Columns:**  
# MAGIC    Includes differences in count, average, percent null, percent zeros, percent distinct, and other statistical tests like:

# MAGIC ## Lineage and Alerts for Drift Detection
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The following instructions are not meant to send you an alert to any device. It is only to demonstrate how to use lineage alongside alerts for your metric tables.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Navigate to Queries**:
# MAGIC    - On the left-hand sidebar of the Databricks workspace, click on **Queries**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Create a Query**:
# MAGIC    - Click on **Create Query** in the top-right corner.
# MAGIC    - Write a query to calculate the maximum value of the median BMI value (this median value is computed per window):
# MAGIC
# MAGIC          select
# MAGIC          max(median) as largest_median
# MAGIC          FROM model_logs_profile_metrics
# MAGIC          WHERE column_name = 'BMI'
# MAGIC          GROUP BY column_name;
# MAGIC    - Give the Query a name like `Drift Alert 1`
# MAGIC    > ****Note:**** Before running the query, make sure to set the current catalog and schema, and follow the `catalog.schema.table_name` structure.
# MAGIC    - Once the query is complete, click **Save** to save it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Create an Alert**:
# MAGIC    - Navigate to **Alerts** on the left-hand sidebar and click **Create Alert**.
# MAGIC    - Provide the alert with a **name** like `Test alert`.
# MAGIC    - In the SQL editor panel, paste the query you have saved before.
# MAGIC > ****Note:**** Before running the query, make sure to set the current catalog and schema, and follow the `catalog.schema.table_name` structure.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC    - Click the **Run all** button to validate the query.
# MAGIC    - Define a **Trigger Condition**:
# MAGIC      - Example: Trigger the alert when the value is above 50 (50 is the max).
# MAGIC    - Click **Test condition**.
# MAGIC      - If the result satisfies the condition, you’ll see:`Triggered: Alert will trigger based on current data.`
# MAGIC    - Under **Notify**, search and add users or destinations. 
# MAGIC    - Finally, click **View alert** and Set the **Schedule**.
# MAGIC ![alert](../Includes/images/alert.png)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Monitor Lineage and Updates**:
# MAGIC    - Go back to the **Catalog** on the left sidebar.
# MAGIC    - Navigate to your **model_logs_profile_metrics** table.
# MAGIC    - Click on **Lineage** and then see the queries associated with this table.
# MAGIC       - You will see the `Drift Alert 1` listed there.
# MAGIC    - Whenever there’s an update or drift detected in your model or dataset, the alert will notify you automatically. You can then go to the table's **Lineage** tab to investigate the issue.

# MAGIC ### Custom Metric Creation: Aggregate metric (using the UI)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC On top of the analysis and drift statistics that are automatically generated with Lakehouse Monitoring, you can create custom metrics as well. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC There are 3 types of custom metrics that can be used with Lakehouse Monitoring:
# MAGIC 1. Aggregated metrics
# MAGIC 1. Derived metrics
# MAGIC 1. Drift metrics
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To create and implement a custom metric in Databricks Lakehouse Monitoring, follow these steps:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Access the Catalog**
# MAGIC    - Navigate to the **Catalog** from the left sidebar menu.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Open Model Logs**
# MAGIC    - In the Catalog, locate and click on **model_logs**.

# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demonstration, we discussed Lakehouse Monitoring and took a deep dive into how to monitor various metrics using Dashboards. You learned about out-of-the-box metrics as well as how to create a custom metric with the UI and programmatically. We also discussed how **Lineage** with Delta tables and **Alerts** can be used within Databricks for sending updates for when drift does occur with your profile and drift metric tables. Finally, you learned about how to set advanced configurations with your inference table such as adding slicers and granularities.
