# MAGIC # Demonstration: Model Rollout Strategies with Mosaic AI Model Serving
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demonstration, we will explore how to perform the rollout strategy known as **A/B testing**. We will also give a brief discussion on how to implement the **Canary Model Rollout Strategy**, a method for releasing an application or service incrementally to a subset of users, as well as Blue Green Rollout. Using Python and Spark, all within the Databricks platform, we will showcase the ease with which we can use Mosaic AI Model Serving and other various tools and features for rollout strategies.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Learning Objectives
# MAGIC - Understand the fundamentals of A/B testing.
# MAGIC - Learn to implement A/B testing frameworks using Spark for scalable data processing.
# MAGIC - Explore how to use Mosaic AI model serving to limit traffic and perform controlled experiments.
# MAGIC - Gain practical experience with Python and Databricks for real-world testing and deployment workflows.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Through this session, you will see how these testing strategies can enhance the reliability and performance of machine learning models and applications in production environments.

# MAGIC ## REQUIRED - SELECT CLASSIC COMPUTE
# MAGIC Before executing cells in this notebook, please select your classic compute cluster in the lab. Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.
# MAGIC Follow these steps to select the classic compute cluster:
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to the top-right of this notebook and click the drop-down menu to select your cluster. By default, the notebook will use **Serverless**.
# MAGIC 1. If your cluster is available, select it and continue to the next cell. If the cluster is not shown:
# MAGIC    - In the drop-down, select **More**.
# MAGIC    - In the **Attach to an existing compute resource** pop-up, select the first drop-down. You will see a unique cluster name in that drop-down. Please select that cluster.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **NOTE:** If your cluster has terminated, you might need to restart it in order to select it. To do this:
# MAGIC 1. Right-click on **Compute** in the left navigation pane and select *Open in new tab*.
# MAGIC 1. Find the triangle icon to the right of your compute cluster name and click it.
# MAGIC 1. Wait a few minutes for the cluster to start.
# MAGIC 1. Once the cluster is running, complete the steps above to select your cluster.

# MAGIC ## Create Two Models for Testing
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here we will read in our dataset and create two initial models. We will utilize MLflow for model tracking and register them to Unity Catalog and provide aliases to separate the different models. We will imagine that we're asked to determine if one model performs better with including two features: `HvyAlcoholConsump` and `HighChol`. We will label model `A` (our control group) as including all features from our baseline `diabetes` dataset while model `B` will not include these two features. We will provide model `A` with alias `@a` and model `B` with alias `@b` in **schema** under **models**.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC We now simulate how you perform A/B testing with Mosaic AI Model Serving. Recall that model B has two fewer features than model A. So, when we send in the query, we want to make sure that we're looking at the larger test set instead of the smaller one. The endpoint will ignore features that don't apply to model B and will use all of the features that apply to model A. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this step we will inference on batches of the test dataset while monitoring which model is being served so we can see the split.

# MAGIC In addition to the frequency of the model served, we can view latency using the UI. Navigate to the model serving endpoint in **Serving** and scroll down to view Metrics. Here you will find Latency, Request Rate, Request Error, CPU Usage, Memory Usage, and Provisioned Concurrency. All of these should be taken into account when making a determination of rolling out a new model. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In the **Events** tab you will see the **Timestamp** along with **Event type**, **Served entity name**, and **message**. This can be useful for transparency in rolling out the model to determine how long it takes for any particular event.

# MAGIC ## Metric Tracking
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that we have established our different models as well as setup our hypothesis, let's take a moment to establish which metrics we will be tracking. Since we are using a random forest classifier, some important metrics include F1-score, precision, recall, accuracy, and AUC-ROC. The table below summarizes the metric, its use case and focus area. We will not go into analysis here, as that is covered in a separate demonstration. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Suggested Tracking Plan
# MAGIC
# MAGIC | **Metric**              | **Use Case**                                  | **Focus Area**                  |
# MAGIC |--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
# MAGIC | **F1-Score**            | Overall balance between precision and recall | Primary metric for A/B testing  |
# MAGIC | **Precision and Recall** | Insights into specific model behaviors       | For deeper performance insights |
# MAGIC | **AUC-ROC or PR AUC**   | Discrimination ability and imbalance focus   | Secondary evaluation            |
# MAGIC | **Log Loss**            | Prediction confidence                        | Confidence assessment           |

# MAGIC ## Additional Rollout Strategies
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We close this demo with describing two additional common rollout strategies that we will go into due to time constraints. However, it is worth describing how Mosaic AI can still solve these problems.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Adaptation to Blue-Green Rollout
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using Mosaic AI Model Serving makes it effortless to switch between different served models. Recall that **Blue-green testing** is a deployment strategy that minimizes the downtime to reduce the risk during the release of new features or updates to applications. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Case 1: Zero Downtime**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If we need 0 downtime, we can simply have two endpoints deployed and expose the application to the correct API and immediately delete the old model serving endpoint. We would maintain both versions of the code but only delete the older one once the new is in use. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Case 2: A Few Minutes Downtime**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If we are allowed to have a few minutes of downtime, we can use the same model serving endpoint and update the version being served by using the following code. Note that this may take a few minutes to update, but we only have a single model serving endpoint deployed in this case. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To summarize, with zero downtime, we must maintain two separate model serving endpoints, which can be costly. If we allow for a few minutes of downtime, then we only have to maintain a single endpoint and simply perform the switch when we are ready. In the latter case, we don't need to maintain two endpoints or worry about cleaning up resources. With Mosaic AI Model Serving, the previous state of the endpoint is always running until the update to the new state is complete. This means the only element you have to adjust your rollout for is the time it takes to update to the new endpoint.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Adaptation to Canary Rollout
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Using Mosaic AI Model Serving, you can perform a gradual rollout by controlling the traffic directed to each model version. Unlike in A/B testing, where we might use a fixed 50/50 split to compare model versions, a canary rollout involves progressively increasing the traffic to the new model. For example, you could start with a 10/90 split (10% to the new model and 90% to the current model), then adjust to a 30/70 split, and so on, until the new model handles 100% of the traffic.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This gradual approach ensures the new model can be validated at scale without sacrificing uptime. Additionally, unlike the blue-green rollout strategy, a canary rollout does not require maintaining separate endpoints. Instead, traffic routing is dynamically adjusted, making it a cost-effective and low-risk strategy for rolling out updates.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demonstration you learned about how to utilize MLflow along with Unity Catalog and Mosaic AI to enforce various rollout strategies with an emphasis on A/B testing. In addition, you learned how providing an alias can help keep track of which model you wish to rollout or test against. Finally, you learned how Mosaic AI allows for split traffic to make rollout strategies like blue-green and canary painless by simply updating the model serving endpoint.
